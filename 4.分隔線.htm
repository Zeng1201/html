        <hr>

        <p>Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away.
            </p>
        <p>And yellow leaves of autumn</p>
        <p>, which have no songs,</p>
        <p>flutter and fall there with a sign.</p>

        The world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover.</br>
        becomes small as one song,</br>
        as one kiss of the eternal.</br>
